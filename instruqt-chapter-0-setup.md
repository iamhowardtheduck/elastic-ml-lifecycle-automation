# Elastic ML Classification Workshop

> *Learn how a fictional mortgage lender's data tells a story of risk — and how
> Elastic Machine Learning turns that story into real-time anomaly alerts,
> behavioral outliers, and predictive models that flag problems before they
> become losses.*


# Chapter 0 — Setup & Environment Review

## Workshop Overview

This focused workshop uses two data sources and two classification jobs to demonstrate
the complete Elastic ML lifecycle — from training a model, to deploying it as a real-time
inference pipeline, to automating the entire process with AI agents and Workflows.

| Part | What you build | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| **Part 1** | **Create** `mortgage-privileged-access-classification` — explore the Kibana wizard, then use Dev Tools to create the job with full `analyzed_fields` includes/excludes and hyperparameters. Train, explore results, deploy as an inference pipeline, observe live predictions in Discover | `logs-ping_one.audit-mortgage` + `logs-oracle.database_audit-mortgage` |
| **Part 2** | Build an AI Agent to analyze historical audit data, then use Elastic Workflows to automatically create and start `mortgage-audit-classification` | `logs-mortgage.audit-default` |
